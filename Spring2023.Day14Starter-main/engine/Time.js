/**
 * The time class
 * Make static calls to this class to get timing information
 * 
 * Notable differences from Unity:
 * - We do not allow for time to be scaled (sped up or slowed down)
 * - We only update at a fixed rate, so deltaTime maps to fixedDeltaTime in Unity
 * - We don't store time values in different formats because js is dynamically typed
